# Communitrip
Communitrip is a web-based application that allows users to plan and go on trips as a community. Users can select a city for their trip, invite others to join in, and collaborate on ideas for places to visit, accommodations, dining, activities, and cost-sharing. This platform allows for seamless trip planning, with users able to contribute and collaborate on every aspect of their upcoming adventure.

## üí°Inspiration

In the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, many people have found themselves feeling increasingly isolated and lonely. Recent research conducted by Harvard has shown that these feelings are on the rise, particularly among older teenagers and young adults. As a society, it's important that we find ways to help people rediscover a sense of belonging and form new connections with others. That's why we created Communitrip, an innovative application that connects people who share a love of travel. By bringing like-minded individuals together, Communitrip enables people to build stronger communities of travelers and form new, meaningful connections that can help combat feelings of isolation and loneliness. Whether you're looking to explore new destinations, make new friends, or simply rediscover the joy of human connection, Communitrip is here to help.

## üî® How we built it

Communitrip is built with React.js and uses the Cohere API, which enables users to interact with the application using natural language. Users can ask the chatbot for recommendations on where to go, what to do, and where to eat, and the chatbot will provide suggestions based on the user's preferences.

## ‚òπÔ∏èChallenges we ran into

- Two first timers with React.js and hackathon!
- Incorporating the chat bot into our design
-Uploading and retrieving images from our firebase data store

## üèÜ Accomplishments that we're proud of

As a team, we were able to:
- Implement major features in 23 hours!
- Develop an application for building strong community

## ü§î What we learned

- Debugging crazy CSS issues
- Some of us learned to use React.js for the first time
- How to incorporate OpenAI for our smart Chatbox

## ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äç What's next for Communitrip

We would love to work with other designers and developers to implement the design into a mobile app. Also, we want to add new features, such as:
- Utilizing GoogleMaps API to find trips by geographical location
- Integrating a scheduling calendar into User dashboard so they can plan trips around existing events
- Add integrations to external booking services such as Airbnb or TripAdvisor
- Allow AI-assisted auto-fill generation of Event details
