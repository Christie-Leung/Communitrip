        "prompt": "I just wanna go buy some groceries for cheap. Living in vancouver doesn't make it easy since the cost of living is so high here. I would get a costco card but I live alone and can't even finish all the food.", 
        "completion": "That's an excellent idea for reducing food waste and lowering your cost. Here are some ways that I came up with for planning a trip to your local Costco store with an ideal of 4 people for the trip. 
        
        Some great options for bulk buying at Costco Vancouver include:

        Rice
        Pasta
        Canned goods (e.g. beans, tomatoes, soup)
        Frozen fruits and vegetables
        Meat and poultry (if one or more of the 4 people has a deep freezer to store excess)
        Nuts and seeds
        Snacks (e.g. trail mix, chips, crackers)
        Cleaning supplies (e.g. laundry detergent, dish soap, paper towels)
        Personal care items (e.g. shampoo, toothpaste, razors)
    
        Arrange for transportation to and from Costco Vancouver. Depending on the location of the 4 people, they may choose to carpool or use public transportation.
    
        Once at Costco Vancouver, start by browsing the aisles for the items on the shopping list. Take note of the unit price and compare it to regular grocery stores to ensure that buying in bulk is actually cheaper.
    
        When purchasing items, split them evenly between the 4 people. For example, if buying a 10 kg bag of rice, each person would get 2.5 kg. This ensures that each person benefits from the savings of bulk buying.
    
        Consider purchasing a Costco membership if the 4 people plan on doing bulk buying on a regular basis. This can help them save money in the long run.
    
        After finishing shopping, head back home and split the purchased items among the 4 people. It may be helpful to use resealable bags or containers to divide the items.
    
    By following these steps, the 4 people can save money on groceries while still having a variety of options to choose from. Happy shopping!"
